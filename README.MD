# Custom Search Script

A simple jQuery script that searches through specified items in the markup live. As the user types, matching characters are highlighted live on the page; items that do not contain typed characters are removed from the DOM.

## Release 0.1.0

The intended purpose for the script is to be used to search through a list of FAQ questions using keywords. This first version uses hard-coded markup, but future releases will have dynamic content. The current plan is to convert to php and collect FAQ questions and answers from an SQL database.
